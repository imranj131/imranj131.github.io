## A Mechanism for Lifting and Lowering the Awning Bar of a Folding Garage

One problem for people who don't have a garage in their house (or enough space in the garage for a second car) is to protect the vehicle parked outside from harsh weather conditions.

I designed a simple, reliable car shelter made of a foldable awning that can be installed on a wall (or floor), as shown on a figure below. The awning is intended to be used for protection of a vehicle, as needed, by simple folding/unfolding with the help of an electric motor.

The mission of this project was to develop a simple, reliable car shelter
made of a foldable awning that can be installed on a floor. The actuator
mechanism, which will permit the lower bar of the awning to rotate around the
end adjacent to the wall, will assist the awnings up and down whilst being
powered via the help of an electric motor. The length of the lower bar is 2.5m,
and it is capable of rotation around the edge adjacent to the wall. The design
solution is requested to be safe, use as few parts as possible and have a low
cost to manufacture and assemble.

The simple and efficient approach I chose will consist of an electric motor
with an output shaft, two spur gears, a rotating shaft, and a rigid lower awning
bar, which will be welded to the rotating shaft.
