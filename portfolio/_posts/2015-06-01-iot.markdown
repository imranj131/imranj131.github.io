## MyoHome Project

In October 2014, I vistied Yale University to attend their hackathon [YHack](http://yhack.org/ "Title"). This time, Jordan Horwich and I built a gesture-controlled smart-home system 'MyoHome'.

Our prototype allows users to control their light as well as their music by simply waving their hand up, down, to the side, etc.

The one thing I learnt that weekend was that the best way to predict the future is indeed to create it!

Our demo at the presentation ceremony was incredible and we were placed [1st place from Intel for the most innovative project!](http://challengepost.com/software/myohome-2rd97/ "Title")
