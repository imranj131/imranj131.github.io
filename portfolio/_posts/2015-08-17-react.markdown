## React 

Last weekend, I was invited to attend [Hack the Planet](http://hacktheplanet.mlh.io/), the Major League Hacking ([MLH](https://mlh.io/))) Finale hackathon for the 2015/2016 season, held in Mountain View, California. My team and I, which consisted of Tabish (Electrical Engineer/ Developer), Ryan (Web Developer), Taaha (UI/UX Designer), and myself (Mechanical Engineer/Developer), built [React](https://reactwearables.xyz//). We were also awarded a prize from [Nest](https://nest.com/) for our innovative integration of the Nest Thermostat into our immersive Street Fighter game.

##Idea

React is an immersive gaming experience powered with wearable technology for any game with keyboard-control. Thus, ranging from games such as Street Fighter to GTA and Tekken.

Most Gamers are tech naturals and therefore a more than interesting target group for the wearable tech market. Wearable gaming products with big market potential are already out there today and can be found [here](https://www.wearable-technologies.com/2015/03/new-devices-for-gaming/). However, React uses body metrics as an input in order for the Gamer to experience and feel the power of their body in the operations of the game.

Controlling machines with the human brain the way brain controls the human body has been the stuff of science fiction for decades. But recent research in the medical field and the arrival of virtual reality hardware in the gaming realm have brought the technology closer to reality. For the immediate future, medicine and gaming will be the areas offering the most opportunity for BCI (Brain Computer Interface) developers, but it won't be much longer before other industries follow.

In order to build React we had to build two custom pieces of hardware and intergrate three existing consumer electronic products.

1. EEG Headset (Custom built with [Open BCI](http://www.openbci.com/) and electrodes)
2. EMG Armband (Thalmic Lab's [MYO](https://www.myo.com/))
3. Gyroscrope and Accelerometer Chest Band (iPhone)
4. FSR Foot Insole (Custom built with Arduino UNO and [xBee]())
5. Smart-Thermostat (Nest)

In addition to hardware and integration, we worked with four APIs. 

1. [Nest](https://nest.com/) for temperature control of the room in real-time
2. [Myo](https://www.myo.com/) for EMG muscle control 
3. [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/ios/) to access Gyroscopic and Accelerometer data
4. [WIN32](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff818516) for keyboard mapping

##Tinkering

Building [React](https://reactwearables.xyz//)http://particle.io/) required a lot of planning. Frequently we did not know how we could make it more immersive. However, as we kept hacking away, more and more ideas started coming up and were thus implemented.

We had a lot of issues with wireless transmission for our foot insole. This was mainly due to a painful time-lag while using the [Particle](http://particle.io/) with it's built in WiFi/cloud service. Hence, we decided to stick to traditional RF and went with the xBee. Fortunately, Tabish our Electrical Engineer had previous experience with foot wearables and RF at his internship with [Atlas Wearables](https://www.atlaswearables.com/) and thus we kept moving forward faster.

Working with the [OpenBCI](http://www.openbci.com/) was a breeze thanks to their clear and concise documentation. The hardest part was making sense of EEG data and guesstimating how to map various frquencies within various thresholds to a specific combination of moves in the game.

Building the EEG headband was a fun process as Taaha assisted me with his experience in UX Design.

Finally, as Ryan integrated the iOS and Nest API, we were comfortable enough with our working prototype and thanks to the continued support from Andrew Urman we were able to add in temperature control based on the users' activity level in order to make the gaming experience truly immersive!
