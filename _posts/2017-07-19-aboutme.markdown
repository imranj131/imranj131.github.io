## I am a problem solver and get excited about tackling challenging problems.

### Born and raised in Colombo; built in Montreal; tuned in Silicon Valley.

My insatiable curiosity has led me to explore crossovers in multiple disciplines, from management to entrepreneurship, hardware to software, and product design to manufacturing.

In 2013, I moved to Montreal and started McGill University to study mechanical engineering.

* In 2014, I interned at 3M, a multinational conglomerate.

* In 2015, I interned at reelyActive, an internet of things startup

* In 2016, I co-founded rhodium, a design consultancy.

* In 2017, I interned at Carbon, an additive manufacturing startup.

* In 2018, I hope to graduate and move on to bigger/better things.

I am fascinated by design because it provides the bridge between research and development, art and engineering, technical performance and human behaviour.

I am intrigued by the beauty of mathematics as it assists humanity in search for patterns and continually offers us invaluable insight into our world.

I get excited by working in multidisciplinary teams on moonshot projects.

I love to travel and find inspiration from people, places, and cultures.

I also enjoy road trips, live music, and authentic food.
