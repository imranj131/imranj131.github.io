React is a project I worked on at [Hack The Planet (HTP)](https://htp-s2015.devpost.com/) in Summer 2015 over a weekend. HTP was a hackathon based in Mountain View, CA where hackets were invited based on their participation in [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) sanctioned events over the course of the past season.
