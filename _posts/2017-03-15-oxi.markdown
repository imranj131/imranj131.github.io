## Oxi, a new line of sleek, wireless earbuds enclosed in a capsule designed to ease into your lifestyle, as easily as your pocket.


Oxi was designed as a part of a design challenge for my interview process with Carbon for a summer internship. 

Edit: I got the internship!

(NOTE: THIS IS A CONCEPT I CAME UP WITH AND IT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH JBL)
