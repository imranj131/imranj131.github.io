## Meta is a wearable wristband designed using mechanical metamaterials.

Meta was 3d printed using a elastomeric polyurethane with Carbon's digital light synthesis (DLS) technology.

The unique feature about Meta is the mechanical metamaterial it is designed with. These are artificial structures with mechanical properties defined by their structure rather than their composition.

This structure features special properties such as constant or near constant force extensions, allowing for bands that have elasticities that feel similar on people with varied wrist/forearm sizes.
