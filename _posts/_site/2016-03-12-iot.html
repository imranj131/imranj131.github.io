<h2 id="myohome-project">MyoHome Project</h2>

<p>In October 2014, I vistied Yale University to attend their hackathon ‘YHack’. This time, Jordan Horwich and I built a gesture-controlled smart-home system ‘MyoHome’. </p>

<p>Our prototype allows users to control their light as well as their music by simply waving their hand up, down, to the side, etc. </p>

<p>This enabled us to control lighting as well as music by waving out hand up, down, right, left, etc.</p>
