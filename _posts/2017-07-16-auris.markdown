## Auris is a headphone earpad designed for optimal comfort and compliance.

Auris was 3d printed using an elastomeric polyurethane with Carbon's digital light synthesis (DLS) technoloy.

Auris is designed with a conformal lattice structure that wraps around the geometry of an earphone pad.

A lattice is explored as opposed to a foam since there is better control of cell arrangement in lattice materials, whereas foams are generally characterized by a stochastic arrangement of cells.
