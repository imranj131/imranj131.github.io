## SENSOCK 

In May 2015, I visited Toronto to attend the WearHacks Toronto hackathon [WearHacks](https://wearhackstoronto.splashthat.com// "Title"). My partner, Rashad Ajward and I built a smart sock with an integrated biometric sensor system, 'Sensock' to faciliate the evergrowing idea of Remote Patient Monitoring.

##Idea

Remote health monitoring solutions combine specialized hardware and software to collect various biometric data from an individual. Whether its assisting patients suffering from a chronic illness or recovering from a hospital stay, consumers who want to actively manage their personal fitness, or families wishing to keep track of a loved one with some level of physical impairment. Thus, the selection of remote monitoring solutions continues to grow at a rapid rate.

Furthermore, with the growing solutions with Wearable Technology and the the Internet of Things, we realised most biometric data would be collected off wearables such as fitness trackers and smartwatches. 

However, as we focus on a different demographic, i.e. patients and elders, we realised the need for wearables that are non obstrusive and non instrusive. Patients don't like being reminded that they are sick, and therefore the existing wearable technology solutions in the case of medical monitoring do not act in the favor of the patient, but rather is uncomfortable and is a pain to the patient.

Thus tapping into a simple ubiquitous garment such as a sock, that we all wear socks on a daily basis, we builded a sensor network within existing socks. 

In our solution, [SENSOCK](https://sensock.github.io/// "Title"), a hospital care giver, a doctor or a loved one can have access to this biometric data at any point in time and doesn’t have to be physically present in the patient’s room to review the readings. This acts as an effective early warning system, identifying problems or issues early enough to prevent the need for dangerous circumstances.

##Tinkering

In order to embed our microprocessor into the sock, we used a Arduino Lillypad, designed for textiles and wearables. (Yes, we learnt how to sew!)

Building [SENSOCK](https://sensock.github.io/// "Title") required a lot of planning, sol eadboard circuitry, programming and coffee.

After burning various sensors, and after multiple visits to [Creatron Inc](https://www.creatroninc.com/// "Title") and [Hardware Home](http://www.homehardware.ca/en/index.htm/// "Title"), we were finally able to build a sensor network which could read data off a human!

In addition to building the hardware, we implemented two APIs. [Plotly](https://plot.ly//// "Title") for data visualisation of the biometrics in real time, and [Twillio](https://www.twilio.com/// "Title") for emegency text message paging upon tapping one's foot on the side of the door.
