## Topolo is a topology optimized bracket designed for an automotive component.

Topolo was 3d printed with a rigid polyurethane using Carbon's digital light synthesis (DLS) technology.

The topology was optimized by defining loading conditions, running an FEA simulation, and minimizing material usage/maximizing stiffness.
