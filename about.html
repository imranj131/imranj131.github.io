      <h4> Hi, I'm Imran. </h4>
    </div>

  <p> I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca">McGill University</a> with a concentration in Design and a minor in Technological Entrepreneurship. </p>

  <p>I was born, and grew up in <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Sri+Lanka/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2593cf65a1e9d:0xe13da4b400e2d38c?sa=X&ei=UUsXVarnJ4aYNoO3g9AN&ved=0CBwQ8gEwAA">Colombo, Sri Lanka</a> and I now live in Montreal, Canada. </p>

  <p>From my childhood, I have had an entrepreneurial mind and this always made me insatiably curious to find innovative solutions to solve compelling problems. </p>

  <p>I am driven by my deep passion for engineering and technology, and I get immense satisfaction by trying to apply it in a way that can benefit society at large. </p>

  <p>I have experience in Product Design, Hardware Integration, Project Management and IT Consulting. </p>

  <p>I also have a passion for tinkering and building cool stuff. </p>
