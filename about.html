      <h4> Hi, I'm Imran. </h4>
    </div>

  <p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Sri+Lanka/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2593cf65a1e9d:0xe13da4b400e2d38c?sa=X&ei=UUsXVarnJ4aYNoO3g9AN&ved=0CBwQ8gEwAA">Colombo, Sri Lanka</a>, and now live in Montr&eacuteal, Canada. </p>

  <p>I live at the intersection of innovative technology, thoughtful design, and meaningful business. I am driven by my deep passion for engineering, and I get immense satisfaction by trying to apply it in a way that can benefit society at large. </p>

  <p>I am a strong advocate for innovation and techonlogy and believe it has the potential to disrupt various industries, and cause numerous economic and life improvements. </p>

  <p>As one of my favourite engineer/entrepreneur/venture capitalist, Chamath Palihapitiya says, "Moving the world forward is an exclusive thing. I want to be a merchant of progress". </p>
  
  <p>When I'm not following tech blogs, tinkering, or hacking things, I enjoy singing and playing the guitar, capturing moments through photography, and going out on fishing trips with my dad.</p>
