As FORTUNE desribes " At age 38, he’s closer in age to the millennials than to the VC baby boomers, with a generationally appropriate resume, having helped Facebook go from campus sensation to global phenomenon (and having become very wealthy thanks to its IPO). Palihapitiya is now best known for a VC fund of his own, Social+Capital Partnership, which he launched in 2011. He’s also an avid poker player, and a partial owner of the NBA’s Golden State Warriors."

>I’ll tell you the three things that I’m most excited by. The first is sensor networks. I’m extremely excited about that. The second is actually this push towards automated transportation. And the third is around a very specific application of big data.

>I believe very strongly in the value of technology, its ability to sort of improve productivity. The problem with many of the productivity gains that we see in the economy today is they actually leave more people behind, in many ways, than they pull forward. So one way to think about that is that as more and more things become technological by definition—less mechanical and more technological—you actually need more technical people. And so the way to think about that is, for example, when you think about education. Education today teaches you social science, it teaches you philosophy, it teaches you English, it teaches you math. But we don’t view technological understanding, or the knowledge of a framework, as the equivalent of understanding any other language.

> This is where, honestly, I feel there is so many of us that are at this fork in the road where it’s like, “Am I really going to try something crazy or am I going to do the iterative next thing?” I don’t know health care but should I try to start something there? I don’t know education. Should I start something there? Or should I improve macros in excel? I think a lot of us, unfortunately, take the road that path. This is where I feel like I feel lucky to be here. I feel every day when I encounter people it’s kind of telling them like, “Hey man. Whether you were born here or not or you’re here the point is you’re going to be celebrated for failing so you might as well be celebrated for doing something crazy. Because if you’re successful you’ll be celebrated for doing something successful. But more importantly you’ll be merchant of progress. That is the sickest thing in the world that you can be. Not rich, not cool, not popular but you move the world forward. That’s an illusive thing. You know? Like for me that’s like the only thing now that I give a shit about. I want that. I want to be a merchant of progress. I don’t know how to do that but I’m going to try.
